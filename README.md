# marketplace_webscraper
Stupid simple Facebook Marketplace Web Scraper. Not aiming to pretty, just the rough proof of concept. Using Node.js/Puppeteer/Cheerio

# Usage

1. Clone Repository
2. Open Terminal. `cd` into directory. execute `npm i`
3. (Optional) Edit Search Query/Search URL.
4. Execute `node index.js`
5. Sit back, relax, and wait a while :)

The scraped page will be filtered and saved as 'test.json'.
It will also be compiled into a basic search result page called 'test.html'
